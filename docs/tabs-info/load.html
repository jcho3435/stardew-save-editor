<p>
    Load your save file here. Always make sure to save your current changes before loading a new file. The editor does not check for unsaved changes. If you load a new file before saving, you will lose your changes.
    Save files are backed up every time they are loaded. You can find your save files in the backups directory. Backups are never automatically deleted.
