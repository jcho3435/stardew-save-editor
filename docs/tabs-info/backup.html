<h2>Backups Manager Tab</h2>

<p>
    The backups manager currently only supports deleting backups. It is unlikely that it will ever support loading backups. <br>
    The backups manager allows for deleting all backups, deleting all backups of a specific farm, and deleting selected backups, which are selected in the list boxes on the page.<br>
