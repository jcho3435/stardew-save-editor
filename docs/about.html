<h2>About the editor:</h2>

<p>
    This editor is for windows because I don't want to have to think about other operating systems. The code is fully open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcho3435/stardew-save-editor">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Version info:<br>
    Stardew Save Editor Version: v0.2-prerelease<br> <!--TODO: Change this on every version-->
    Python version: 3.12.4<br>

    <br>
    There is no input validation on any of the modifiable fields, so in order to avoid Stardew Valley crashing due to bad save data, avoid inputting bad values. For example, for fields which should take a number, do not input any alphabetical characters. Details on constaints on input values can be found in each tab on the docs. Also, if a field should have a value in it, do not leave it blank. For example, don't leave your farmer name blank.<br>

    All error logs and event logs are located in `logs/`<br>
    Logs can be cleaned by running `clean_logs.bat`, located in scripts/. This will delete all logs older than 2 weeks.
