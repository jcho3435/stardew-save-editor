<h2>About the editor:</h2>

<p>
    This editor is for windows because I don't want to have to think about other operating systems. The code is fully open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcho3435/stardew-save-editor">here</a><br>
    Written in python 3.12, using PySimpleGUI.<br>
    <br>
    There is no input validation on any of the modifiable fields, so in order to avoid stardew valley crashing due to bad save data, avoid inputting bad values. For example, for fields which should take a number, do not input and alphabetical characters. Details on constaints on input values can be found in each tab on the docs.<br>
    <br>
    All error logs and event logs are located in `logs/`<br>
    Logs can be cleaned by running `clean_logs.bat`, located in scripts/. This will delete all logs older than 2 weeks.
