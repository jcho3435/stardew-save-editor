# Stardew Valley Save Editor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This editor is for windows because I don't want to think about other operating systems.<br>
Written in python 3.12

All error logs and event logs are located in `logs/`<br>
Logs can be cleaned by running `clean_logs.bat`, located in scripts/

If using pyinstaller to compile the `runner.py` script into an executable, run `pyinstaller -wF runner.py`<br>
