# TODO: Test the issue occurring on the backups tab

# Create a tab layout
# All of the contents of the tab should be encapsulated in a column- scrollable, expand_x, and expand_y, vscroll only
# Inside the column, have a button to add frames with a listbox size (40, 12) and a button in the same row
# Have another column with a push() element in the same row. Frame elements get added to this column
# After every addition of a frame, call contents_changed()
